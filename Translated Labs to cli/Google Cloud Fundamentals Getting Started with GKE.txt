# Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with GKE

## Objectives:
In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

	- Provision a Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Engine.

	- Deploy and manage Docker containers using kubectl.

## Steps:

1. Confirm that needed APIs are enabled:

	- For this project we will need these APIs to be enabled:

		Kubernetes Engine API

		Container Registry API

	- You can enable them using the following command:

		gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com

		gcloud services enable containerregistry.googleapis.com


2. Start a Kubernetes Engine cluster using the command line:

	export MY_ZONE=us-central1-a
	
	gcloud container clusters create webfrontend --zone $MY_ZONE --num-nodes 2

	- After the cluster is created, check your installed version of Kubernetes using the kubectl version command:

		kubectl version

	- View your running nodes in the GCP Console:

		gcloud compute instances list --zone us-central1-a

3. Run and deploy a container:

	- From your Cloud Shell prompt, launch a single instance of the nginx container:

		kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:1.17.10

	- View the pod running the nginx container:

		kubectl get pods

	- Expose the nginx container to the Internet:

		kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancer

	- View the new service:

		kubectl get services

	- Open a new web browser tab and paste your cluster's external IP address into the address bar.

	- Result:

		The default home page of the Nginx browser is displayed.

	- Scale up the number of pods running on your service:

		kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3

	- Confirm that Kubernetes has updated the number of pods:

		kubectl get pods

	- Confirm that your external IP address has not changed:

		kubectl get services

	- Return to the web browser tab in which you viewed your cluster's external IP address, refresh the page.

	- Result:
		 
		Nginx web server is still responding.
